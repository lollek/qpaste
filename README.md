Paste-from-file application for Win7
When this application is done you will be able to add lines to a text-document, and when you press Alt-c, it will create a drop-down menu from which you can select any of the lines.
Doing so will paste the line to the active window.
It should also be possible to press Alt-c 1 to paste the first line.

This is a very slow work in progress as I need to test it on a Windows machine, and I don't have direct access to one.
